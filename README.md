# aframe-boilerplate-webpack
⛺️ A-Frame boilerplate using Webpack.

## 📖 Introduction
A-Frame boilerplate that uses Webpack to bundle the A-Frame framework and creates a server using Webpack Dev Server.

## ⚙ Installation & Development
### Tech Stack
* [Webpack 4.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)
* [Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)

*Note:* This boilerplate uses the community version of [HTML Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-webpack-plugin) since the official plugin isn't compatible with Webpack 4.0. This should be [fixed](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/issues/860) this week.
